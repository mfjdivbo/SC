neural network regression for solidification cracking data

'final datasheet.xlsx' is the dataset of excel version.
'data487by22.mat' is the matlab's mat file.
'DNN4layers.m' is the code about deep neural network and autoencoders.
'SNN1layers.m' is the code about shallow neural network.
use matlab to open the .mat and .m files and run them directly.
